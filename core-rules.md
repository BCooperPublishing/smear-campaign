## Key Game Concepts

### Fun First, Immersion Second, and Realism Third. 
All math in this game is based on simple logic. The goal of SMEAR Campaign is to get players to think more about *roleplaying* and *tactics* instead of getting caught up in *math* and *metagaming*. The statistics are meant to provide a firm, immersive world that bites back when you push on it.

Even more important than immersion is the simple joy of talking about a fun story with friends.

Games that include elements of realism can be a great way to practice problem solving, strategy, and philosophical debates.

### Rule of 6, 5, 3, 1
The rules for this game are inspired by the humble 6-sided die. What it lacks in esoteric mystique, it more than makes up for in accessibility.
| Number | Significance |
| -- | -- |
| 6 | The maximum value that can be rolled on a 6-sided die. 6 Represents one "Major" unit, similar to a meter. |
| 5 | (6 Rounded down) For GMs doing quick maths, 5 is an easier number to add and multiply in base 10. This rulebook relies on 5 instead of 6 as the "Major Unit" for statistics. 
| 3 | (3.5 rounded down) 3 can be thought of as the "Medium" unit, since it represents the average result of rolling a 6-sided die.|
| 1 | 1 is used as the "Basic" unit, since it is the smallest number used in SMEAR Campaign. Whole integers only, no decimals or fractions.

### Dice and Dots
- The core mechanic of SMEAR Campaign.
- When checking for any stat, roll the "Dice" number of dice for that stat, and add the "Dots" number to the result. 
- Situations, Equipment, and other factors may also add or subtract temporary "Situational Modifier(s)" and / or "Equipment Modifier(s)"

### Round Down, Not Up
GMs should err on the side of smaller numbers when rounding in math. Smaller numbers give players more room to grow and progress, which is the life of the game.
Exception: Rule of cool during a dramatic dice roll.

### Exploding Sixes
When rolling for damage, any dice that land on 6 can "exploded" by rolling again, and adding the resulting number will to the Damage Total. Continue to "explode" any sixes until you run out of dice to reroll.


## Character Creation

### Character Details
- Player Name
- Character Name
- Character Archetype
  - Race, Class, or basic description "like Indiana Jones with a Axe"

- Types of Devotions: (stolen from D20 Modern's Allegiances)
  - Person or Group
  - Organization
  - Nation
  - Belief System

- [Lists Per Major Stat]

- [Example Character: M:longBlade and R:shortBlade]




### Hit Points
- HP = ( Endurance[dice] *3 ) + Endurance(dots)

### Example Characters
- Fighter
- Ranger
- Thief
- Wizard
- Battlemage

## Combat

### Attacker's Action
- For basic play, just roll the appropriate Stat for the Weapon Archetype. Roll once to see if the hit lands successfully, and roll again to determine how much damage is dealt.

- For advanced play, you can also use the Advanced Techniques from the weapon's archetype or the Unique Weapon Card.

### Target's Reaction
If a character is aware of an incoming attack, they can normally choose one of these actions as an immediate response to an Attack (unless some condition prevents one or all of these options)

- Dodge
  - Roll [R:dodge](#reflex "Reflex"). If the result is greater than or equal to the Attacker's Damage Roll, the attack is completely avoided.

- Block
  - BASIC: Roll [M:block](#might "Might") plus/minus your Shield or Weapon Archetype's Blocking Grade
  - ADVANCED: You may instead select a Blocking Technique from an equipped shield, weapon, etc.

- Attack
  - You must take the full amount of damage from the attack. Then (if your character hasn't been knocked out or killed), roll for your own attack. This does not affect your next turn in combat.

### Weapons
- Every weapon fits an archetype with a few basic Techniques. Each archetype has Advanced Techniques to make the weapon more 

#### Weapon Parts
- Fast way to add or remove Advanced Techniques from a Unique Weapon.
- [List]

#### Unique Weapon Card
- Use an index note to record the following details about a unique weapon:
  - Weapon Name
  - Weapon Archetype
  - Weapon Grade (-3 => +3)
  - (If Necessary) Weapon Parts
    - Additional to Archetype
    - Removed from Archetype
  - (If Necessary) Fine Details
    - Additional to Archetype
    - Removed from Archetype


### Armor and Damage Reduction
- Target character rolls [Armor Stat](#endurance "Endurance") plus/minus Armor( or armor piece)'s Armor Grade ( -3 => +3...)
- In basic play, characters have only 1 slot for their entire armor set.
- In advanced play, GMs may add an infinite number of armor slots for targeting and resisting damage.
- *Add limb targeting mechanics*

#### Advanced Rule: Body and Specific Armor Parts
- GMs can specify as many minute armor parts as desired for detail, from chestpieces and leggings to pauldrons and greaves.

## Magic

### Known Spells
- You can learn a number of spells equal to [A:{castingStat}[dice]](#arcane "Arcane"), for each Casting Stat.

  - Stop Motion
  - Slow Motion
  - Cryomancy
  - Pyromancy
  - Raise Dead
  - Heal Wound
  - Read Mind
  - Plant Idea
  - Confuse
  - etc

### Daily Spellcasting Limit
- Each day, you can cast spells a number of times equal to

    ( [Arcane[dice]](#arcane "Arcane") * 3 )
  \+ [Arcane(dots)](#arcane "Arcane")

### Additional Materials from the 5B GameMaster's Guide
I have decided to steal the entire "Negotiating Spells" section of the 5B Game Master's Guide. These rules are included below.
> #### NEGOTIATING SPELLS:
> The important thing about Magic-User Spells is that the Player decides the effect. Spells are most difficult when a Player decides on a big effect and then doesn't make a roll high enough to achieve it. Here, it's up to the GM and Player to collaborate on an effect that feels satisfying. Generally, a Spell will do one thing perfectly or a couple things less well. For instance, an ice ray can just deal its damage, or it can deal its damage and hold its target in place. If the Player wants the second option the spell could deal half damage and hold until the Players next turn, or do full damage but allow for a Saving Throw to avoid both effects. Consider the Tier of Power and its limitations on factors like time, distance, and targets.
> 
> #### Possible Spell Effects Per Power Tier
> 
>   ##### Stopping An Opponent From Moving:
>   | Power Tier| Spell Effect|
>   | -- | -- |
>   | Mundane | A strong wind slows enemy for a moment |
>   | Supernatural | Ropes levitate and wrap around enemy |
>   | Awesome | Conjured iron chains anchor enemy to ground |
>   | Legendary | All strength drains from enemy until they say a specific word |
>   | Epic | Enemy is frozen in stasis until a counter ritual is performed |
>   | Godly | Enemy is trapped inside a gemstone until freed |
>   
>   ##### Divining The Safest Course of Action:
>   | Power Tier| Spell Effect|
>   | -- | -- |
>   | Mundane | The sun shines brighter on the better path |
>   | Supernatural | A cryptic message tells you what to do |
>   | Awesome | Sporadic flashes of future insight until you rest |
>   | Legendary | Witness a significant future event |
>   | Epic | See multiple futures and what steps lead to each |
>   | Godly | Alter reality to create a perfect outcome |
>   
>   ##### Changing the Caster's Physicality:
>   | Power Tier| Spell Effect|
>   | -- | -- |
>   | Mundane | Gain an animal's sense of smell |
>   | Supernatural | Grow or shrink significantly |
>   | Awesome | Breath fire like a dragon for a short time |
>   | Legendary | Transform into an natural animal |
>   | Epic | Become a great mythical creature |
>   | Godly | Take on god-like powers at the cost of your mind |


## Religion
I have decided to steal the entire "Generating Prayers" section of the 5B Game Master's Guide. These rules are included below.

  > ### GENERATING PRAYERS:
  > The important thing about Cleric Prayers is that the Player states their problem. It's then up to the GM to figure out how the Deity would address it. Try to never go with the most direct or obvious answer and use the Deity's [Domain](#domains-and-effects "Domains and Effects") as a guide. As a general rule, Prayer effects should fall into the [Awesome](#possible-spell-effects-per-power-tier "Spell Power Tiers") or [Legendary](#possible-spell-effects-per-power-tier "Spell Power Tiers") Tiers of Power. While any deity is technically capable of [Godly](#possible-spell-effects-per-power-tier "Spell Power Tiers") Tier effects, it is unlikely they would use one for a mortal follower. However, feel free to offer an extremely powerful effect, like resurrection, if the Player rolls very high, the [Domain](#domains-and-effects "Domains and Effects") makes sense, and there is some supporting narrative. You may also use the table below to randomly determine the diety ' s or spark an idea.
  > 
  > #### Potential Deity Response Table (2d6)
  > | 2d6 | Deity Response Idea                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
  > | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  > | 2   | Deity misinterprets the request, is offended by it, feels like the cleric should show some more grit, or decides the situation calls for vague hints rather than miraculous action. In any case, the effect of the prayer is mostly useless. |
